# Udacity AWS Cloud Architect Nanodegree

## Project 01 - Recoverability In AWS

This is one of the project in Udacity AWS Cloud Architect Nanodegree.

## Overview

In this project, I've created highly available solutions to common use cases, including:

- Build a Multi-AvailabilityZone, Multi-Region database and show how to use it in multiple geographically separate AWS regions.

- Build a website hosting solution that is versioned so that any data destruction and accidents can be quickly and easily undone.
